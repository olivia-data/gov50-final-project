## Project Thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the representation of women in major museums. I'm especially interested in whether or not there is a significant difference between the amount of women depicted in the art and the amount of art created by women. Do male artists' works tend to be put on display more often than female artists' works? Does the number of female artists bear on the proportions in which women are depicted in a museum's art collection?
